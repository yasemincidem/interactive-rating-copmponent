# Interactive rating component
This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM.
This is implemented CSS, HTML and vanilla js.

# Challenge:

Your users should be able to:

Select and submit a number rating
See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
